## Above-the-Fold Checklist

The first 500-700 characters must include:
1. A clear, benefit-focused headline
2. A supporting value proposition
3. A visible CTA (button or link)
4. At least one trust signal (social proof, testimonial, stat)

**5-Second Test**: If a visitor can't identify what you offer, who it's for, and what to do next within 5 seconds, the page fails.

| Element | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Action verb | "Start", "Get", "Try" | "Submit", "Click Here" |
| Benefit-oriented | "Start Your Free Trial" | "Sign Up" |
| Urgency | "Start Free Today" | "Learn More" |
| Specificity | "Get Your 14-Day Trial" | "Get Started" |

### Distribution

- At least 1 CTA above the fold (first 20%)
- At least 1 CTA in mid-page (30-70%)
- At least 1 closing CTA (last 20%)
- Total: 3-5 CTAs for SEO pages, 2-3 for PPC pages
