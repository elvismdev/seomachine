# Opportunity Scoring Methodology

## 8-Factor Weighted Model

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Volume | 25% | Monthly search volume (higher = more traffic potential) |
| Position | 20% | Current SERP position (11-20 = quick win zone) |
| Intent | 20% | Commercial/transactional intent (higher = more valuable) |
| Competition | 15% | Keyword difficulty (lower = easier to rank) |
| Cluster | 10% | Topic cluster value (supports pillar content) |
| CTR | 5% | Current click-through rate (low = meta improvement opportunity) |
| Freshness | 5% | Content age (older = refresh opportunity) |
| Trend | 5% | Search trend direction (rising = growing opportunity) |

## Priority Levels

| Score | Priority | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 80-100 | CRITICAL | Immediate action — high impact, time-sensitive |
| 60-79 | HIGH | Prioritize this quarter |
| 40-59 | MEDIUM | Schedule for next quarter |
| 20-39 | LOW | Backlog — address when capacity allows |
| 0-19 | SKIP | Not worth pursuing at this time |
