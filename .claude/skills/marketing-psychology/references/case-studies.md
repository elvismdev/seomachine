# Marketing Psychology Case Studies

## Loss Aversion

### Principle
People feel losses roughly 2x as strongly as equivalent gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).

### Application Examples
- **Free trial expiration**: "Your data will be deleted in 3 days" outperforms "Upgrade to keep your data"
- **Feature gating**: Showing features in the UI that require upgrade (grayed out) creates loss aversion for what they "could have"
- **Price anchoring**: Showing the annual price crossed out next to the monthly price frames the monthly as a "loss"

### When to Use
- Churn prevention emails
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- Upgrade prompts
- Exit intent popups

### When NOT to Use
- First impressions (too aggressive)
- Brand-building content
- Customer support interactions

## Social Proof

### Principle
People look to others' actions to determine their own, especially in uncertain situations (Cialdini, 1984).

### Types by Effectiveness
1. **Specific customer results**: "Acme Corp reduced churn by 34% in 90 days" (strongest)
2. **Named testimonials with photos**: Real people with attributable quotes
3. **Aggregate numbers**: "Join 10,000+ teams" (weaker but scalable)
4. **Logos**: Recognizable brand logos (visual trust signal)
5. **Star ratings**: G2/Capterra scores with review counts

### Placement Best Practices
- Near CTAs (reduces hesitation at decision point)
- After benefit claims (provides proof)
- In email subject lines ("See why 5,000 teams switched")
- On pricing pages (addresses "is this worth it?" anxiety)

## Anchoring Effect

### Principle
The first number people see influences subsequent judgments (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

### Application Examples
- **Pricing page**: Show enterprise tier first ($299/mo) to make pro tier ($49/mo) feel reasonable
- **ROI calculators**: "Companies like yours waste $50,000/year on..." anchors the value of your $500/mo tool
- **Competitor comparison**: Lead with competitor's higher price before showing yours

## Endowment Effect

### Principle
People value things more once they feel ownership (Thaler, 1980).

### Application Examples
- **Free trials with data**: Let users input their own data during trial — they'll value the populated account
- **Personalized dashboards**: Custom setup during onboarding creates ownership feeling
- **Progress indicators**: "You've completed 60% of setup" — they don't want to lose progress

---

## Paradox of Choice

### Principle
More options lead to decision paralysis and lower satisfaction (Schwartz, 2004).

### Application Examples
- **Pricing tiers**: 3 tiers optimal. 5+ causes paralysis
- **Feature pages**: Highlight 3-5 key benefits, not 20 features
- **CTAs**: One primary CTA per page. Secondary CTA only if genuinely different path
- **Plan recommendation**: "Most popular" or "Recommended" badge reduces choice anxiety

---

## Reciprocity

### Principle
People feel obligated to return favors (Cialdini, 1984).

### Application Examples
- **Free tools**: Give genuine value before asking for anything (engineering as marketing)
- **Free content**: In-depth guides, templates, calculators — then ask for email
- **Concierge onboarding**: White-glove setup creates obligation to give the product a fair chance
- **Free migration**: Removing switching costs creates goodwill and obligation

## Urgency and Scarcity

### Principle
Limited availability or time pressure increases perceived value and action.

### Ethical Applications
- **Real deadlines**: "This pricing ends Friday" (if it actually does)
- **Genuine scarcity**: "12 spots left in this cohort" (if actually limited)
- **Seasonal offers**: Black Friday, New Year deals with real end dates

### Unethical Applications (Avoid)
- Fake countdown timers that reset
- "Only 2 left!" when there are unlimited
- Perpetual "limited time" offers
