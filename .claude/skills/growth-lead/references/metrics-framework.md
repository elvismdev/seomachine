# Growth Metrics Framework

## The Metrics Hierarchy

Revenue is the only metric that ultimately matters. Everything else is a leading indicator.

```

├── MRR / ARR
├── ARPU × Active Customers
└── New Revenue + Expansion - Churn

Conversion (leading)
├── Traffic → Signup Rate
├── Signup → Activation Rate
├── Activation → Paid Rate
└── Paid → Expansion Rate

Activity (diagnostic)
├── Traffic by source
├── Feature usage
├── Engagement frequency
└── Support volume
```
